# 👗 OneCart — Clothing E-Commerce App with Firebase Auth & AI Voice Navigation

**OneCart** is a stylish e-commerce web application designed for showcasing and selling clothing products. It includes **Firebase-based user authentication**, a functional **shopping cart**, and **AI-powered voice commands** for seamless navigation — combining tech and fashion into one smart solution.

> 💡 I built this project as part of my hands-on learning journey, where I explored how to integrate user authentication, voice interactivity, and shopping logic in a real-world web app using modern tools.
